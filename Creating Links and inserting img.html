	<h2>FRUITS</h2><hr>

	<p id="one">Fruit, the fleshy or dry ripened ovary of a flowering plant, enclosing the seed or seeds. Thus, apricots, bananas, and grapes, as well as bean pods, corn grains, tomatoes, cucumbers, and (in their shells) acorns and almonds, are all technically fruits. Popularly, however, the term is restricted to the ripened ovaries that are sweet and either succulent or pulpy. For treatment of the cultivation of fruits, see fruit farming. For treatment of the nutrient composition and processing of fruits, see fruit processing.<br>Botanically, a fruit is a mature ovary and its associated parts. It usually contains seeds, which have developed from the enclosed ovule after fertilization, although development without fertilization, called parthenocarpy, is known, for example, in bananas. Fertilization induces various changes in a flower: the anthers and stigma wither, the petals drop off, and the sepals may be shed or undergo modifications; the ovary enlarges, and the ovules develop into seeds, each containing an embryo plant. The principal purpose of the fruit is the protection and dissemination of the seed.</p>

	<h3>TYPES OF FRUITS</h3>

	<ol>
		<li><h4>MANGO</h4>
			<br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Carabao_mangoes_%28Philippines%29.jpg/330px-Carabao_mangoes_%28Philippines%29.jpg" height="290" width="300" class="center">
			<p>“The king of the fruits," mango fruit is one of the most popular, nutritionally rich fruits with unique flavor, fragrance, taste, and heath promoting qualities, making it numero-uno among new functional foods, often labeled as “super fruits."<br>
			Mango is one of the delicious seasonal fruits grown in the tropics. The tree is believed to be originating in the sub-Himalayan plains of the Indian subcontinent. Botanically, this exotic fruit belongs to the family of Anacardiaceae, a family that also includes numerous species of tropical fruiting trees in the flowering plants such as cashew, pistachio.</p></li>

		<li><h4>ORANGE</h4>
			<br><img src="http://missambivert.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/01_oranges_Finally%E2%80%94Here%E2%80%99s-Which-%E2%80%9COrange%E2%80%9D-Came-First-the-Color-or-the-Fruit_691064353_Lucky-Business-750x460.jpg" height="290" width="300" class="center">
			<p>Oranges are among the world’s most popular fruits.<br>
			Also called sweet oranges, they grow on orange trees (Citrus x sinensis) and belong to a large group of fruits known as citrus fruits.<br>
			Their true origin is a mystery, but the cultivation of oranges is thought to have started in eastern Asia thousands of years ago.<br>
			Today, they are grown in most warm regions of the world and consumed either fresh or as juice.<br>
			Oranges are a healthy source of fiber, vitamin C, thiamine, folate, and antioxidants. They have multiple health benefits.<br>
			This article explains everything you need to know about oranges.</p></li>

<section id="ANIMALS"><hr>
	<h2>ANIMALS</h2><hr>
	<p id="two">Animals (also called Metazoa) are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The kingdom Animalia includes humans but in colloquial use the term animal often refers only to non-human animals. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.<br>Humans make use of many other animal species, such as for food (including meat, milk, and eggs), for materials (such as leather and wool), as pets, and as working animals including for transport. Dogs have been used in hunting, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports. Non-human animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.</p>

	<h3>DIFFERENT ANIMALS</h3>

	<ol>
		<li><h4>TIGER</h4>
			<br><img src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/5C51E427-1715-44E6-9B14D9487D7B7F2D_source.jpg" class="center" height="290" width="300"  >
			<p>Tiger, (Panthera tigris), largest member of the cat family (Felidae), rivaled only by the lion (Panthera leo) in strength and ferocity. The tiger is endangered throughout its range, which stretches from the Russian Far East through parts of North Korea, China, India, and Southeast Asia to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The Siberian, or Amur, tiger (P. tigris altaica) is the largest, measuring up to 4 metres (13 feet) in total length and weighing up to 300 kg (660 pounds). The Indian, or Bengal, tiger (P. tigris tigris) is the most numerous and accounts for about half of the total tiger population. Males are larger than females and may attain a shoulder height of about 1 metre and a length of about 2.2 metres, excluding a tail of about 1 metre; weight is 160–230 kg (350–500 pounds), and tigers from the south are smaller than those of the north.</p></li>

		<li><h4>RHINOCEROS</h4>
			<br><img src="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/sites/default/files/2019-05/GreaterOneHornedRhinos_ZN.jpg " class="center" height="290" width="300" >
			<p>There are two types of rhinos found in Africa: black rhino and white rhino. The former can be found in South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Kenya; the latter is found mainly in South Africa but also Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe. Rhinos are a prime poaching target and are critically endangered as a result. The Rhinos Without Borders project is relocating rhinos from South Africa to Botswana (this country has strict anti-poaching laws) as an effort to conserve the species.</p></li>

		<li><h4>ASIAN ELEPHANT</h4>
			<br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Elephas_maximus_%28Bandipur%29.jpg/1200px-Elephas_maximus_%28Bandipur%29.jpg" class="center" height="290" width="300">
			<p>The Asian elephant is the largest land mammal on the Asian continent. They inhabit dry to wet forest and grassland habitats in 13 range countries spanning South and Southeast Asia. While they have preferred forage plants, Asian elephants have adapted to surviving on resources that vary based on the area.<br>
			Asian elephants are extremely sociable, forming groups of six to seven related females that are led by the oldest female, the matriarch. Like African elephants, these groups occasionally join others to form larger herds, although these associations are relatively short-lived. In Asia, elephant herd sizes are significantly smaller than those of savannah elephants in Africa.</p></li>

<section id="SOCIAL MEDIA"><hr>
	<h2>SOCIAL MEDIA</h2><hr>
	<p id="three">Social media is computer-based technology that facilitates the sharing of ideas, thoughts, and information through the building of virtual networks and communities. By design, social media is internet-based and gives users quick electronic communication of content. Content includes personal information, documents, videos, and photos. Users engage with social media via computer, tablet or smartphone via web-based software or web application, often utilizing it for messaging.<br>
	While social media is ubiquitous in America and Europe, China and India now lead the list of social media usage.</p>

	<h3>DIFFERENT SOCIAL MEDIA APPS</h3>

	<ol>
		<li><h4>TELEGRAM</h4>
			<br><img src="https://media.threatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/103/2016/06/06235238/Telegram_Messenger.jpg" class="center" height="200" width="300">
			<p>Telegram is a freeware, cross-platform, cloud-based instant messaging (IM) software and application service. The service also provides end-to-end encrypted video calling, VoIP, file sharing and several other features. It was initially launched for iOS on 14 August 2013 and Android in October 2013. The application servers of Telegram are distributed worldwide to decrease data load, while the operational center is currently based in Dubai.Various Telegram client apps are available for desktop and mobile platforms including official apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS and Linux, as well as for the now-discontinued Windows Phone. There is also an official web interface and numerous unofficial clients that make use of Telegram's protocol. All of Telegram's official apps are open source.</p></li>

		<li><h4>INSTAGRAM</h4>
			<br><img src="https://cwpwp2.betterthanpaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/instagram.jpg" height="200" width="300" class="center">
			<p>Instagram (commonly abbreviated to IG or Insta)[7] is an American photo and video sharing social networking service owned by Facebook, created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger and originally launched on iOS in October 2010. The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can like photos and follow other users to add their content to a feed, a function that seems to be discontinued as of September 2020.</p></li>

		<li><h4>INSTAGRAM</h4>
			<br><img src="https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/LinkedIn.jpg" height="200" width="300" class="center">
			<p>LinkedIn is an American business and employment-oriented online service that operates via websites and mobile apps. Launched on May 5, 2003, the platform is mainly used for professional networking, and allows job seekers to post their CVs and employers to post jobs. As of 2015, most of the company's revenue came from selling access to information about its members to recruiters and sales professionals.[5] Since December 2016, it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft. As of December 2020, LinkedIn had 760 million registered members from 150 countries.<br>
			LinkedIn allows members (both workers and employers) to create profiles and "connect" to each other in an online social network which may represent real-world professional relationships. Members can invite anyone (whether an existing member or not) to become a "connection"</p></li>

<section id="MONUMENTS"><hr>
	<h2>MONUMENTS</h2><hr>
	<p id="four">A monument is a type of structure that was explicitly created to commemorate a person or event, or which has become relevant to a social group as a part of their remembrance of historic times or cultural heritage, due to its artistic, historical, political, technical or architectural importance. Some of the first monuments were dolmens or menhirs, megalithic constructions built for religious or funerary purposes.<br>
	Examples of monuments include statues, (war) memorials, historical buildings, archaeological sites, and cultural assets. If there is a public interest in its preservation, a monument can for example be listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site</p>

	<h3>VARIOUS MONUMENTS</h3>

	<ol>
		<li><h4>The Leaning Tower of Pisa</h4>
			<br><img src="https://www.kids-world-travel-guide.com/images/xital_pisa_500.jpg.pagespeed.ic.tOXMILMJS7.jpg" height="200" width="300" class="center">
			<p>The Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of Italy’s major tourist attractions. The freestanding bell tower of the Pisa Cathedral was built over almost two hundred years and was finished in 1399.<br>
			The original hight of the tower was 60 meters/196ft, but as it is leaning, the lowest side is now less than 56 meters/184ft. The construction already caused many problems as the soil was soft, sandy and unstable. Already during construction, the builders tried to balance the leaning side with more columns on the other side, but the tower still leaned - like many other buildings in the area.<br>
			In 2000, the tower was strengthened by putting stronger soil underneath the tower. You can walk up the 251 stairs to the viewing platform at the top of the tower which is quite an amazing experience. And of course take a picture of you from the lawns next to the tower to 'hold' the tower.</p></li>

		<li><h4>The Great Pyramid of Giza</h4>
			<br><img src="https://www.kids-world-travel-guide.com/images/xpyramids_giza_500.jpeg.pagespeed.ic.L6HuuLoR_9.jpg" height="200" width="300" class="center">
			<p>The Great Pyramid of Giza near Cairo is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and the only one of these ancient world wonders which still exists. The pyramids are made of stone and bricks and stand near Cairo which is the capital of Egypt.<br>
			The Egyptian pyramids were built during a time when there was only manual labour and no machine lifting equipment available. The pyramids were build to house the bodies of the pharaoh who ruled in ancient Egypt. Next to the Giza pyramids there is the Sphinx, the famous monument of a lion body with a pharaoh’s head.</p></li>

		<li><h4>The Taj Mahal</h4>
			<br><img src="https://www.kids-world-travel-guide.com/images/xtajmahal_500.jpg.pagespeed.ic.V6ys_qmH8t.jpg" height="200" width="300" class="center">
			<p>The Taj Mahal, which means 'crown of palaces' in the Persian language, stands on the riverbanks of the Yamuna River in Agra in northern India.<br>
			In 1632 the emperor, Shah Jahan instructed to build a tomb for his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal houses the tomb of the wife as well as a mosque and a guesthouse.<br>
			The Taj Mahal has been built with white marble and the finest material sourced from all over Asia. It is decorated with precious and semi-precious stones. Lines from the Quran are depicted on many walls. The main dome of the Taj Mahal is 35metres/115ft. hight and the minarets are each 40m/130ft. tall.</p></li>
